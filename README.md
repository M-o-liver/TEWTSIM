# TEWTSIM: Tactical Exercise Without Troops Simulator

## Project Overview

TEWTSIM is a web-based application developed to support Canadian Armed Forces training initiatives, with a focus on providing a platform for tactical decision-making at the Infantry School in a low-stakes environment. This tool digitizes Tactical Decision Games (TDGs), offering an interactive platform for CAF personnel to sharpen their critical thinking skills in simulated combat scenarios.

üéñÔ∏è **Developed under the guidance of WO Outar, Platoon Warrant of OPP, Infantry School**

üöÄ **Current Status:** Prototype

üîê **Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED

## Training Benefits

TEWTSIM aims to enhance:
1. Critical thinking in tactical scenarios
2. Decision-making under pressure
3. Strategic approach exploration
4. Preparation for field exercises
5. Tactical textual scenario data collection for organizational analysis and future development

## Installation Guide (Windows Environment)

1. Install XAMPP
   - Select Apache2, PHP, and MySQL/MariaDB components during installation

2. Clone the TEWTSIM repository
   - Execute in command prompt: `git clone https://github.com/M-o-liver/TEWTSIM`
   - Clone into the 'htdocs' folder of your XAMPP installation

3. Configure XAMPP
   - Launch XAMPP control panel
   - Start Apache and MySQL services

4. Set up the database
   - Access phpMyAdmin via the MySQL 'Admin' button in XAMPP
   - Create a new database named "mission_app"
   - Import the SQL file: `C:/xampp/htdocs/TEWTSIM-main/sql/mission_app.sql`
   - Ensure Foreign Key checks are enabled during import

5. Configure Apache
   - Open Apache's `httpd.conf` file
   - Locate the `DocumentRoot` directive
   - Set it to: `DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/TEWTSIM-main"`
   - Save the file

6. Set up API key
   - Create a new file: `/xampp/htdocs/TEWTSIM-main/keys/openaikey.txt`
   - Insert your OpenAI API key into this file

7. Restart Apache
   - In the XAMPP control panel, stop and restart the Apache service

8. Access the application
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost`

Note: For deployment on Linux systems, database configuration may require adjustments. Consult your system administrator or IT support for assistance with Linux deployment.

## Scenario Management

TEWTSIM scenarios are managed through the `missions` table in the database. To add a new scenario:

1. Develop the Tactical Decision Game (TDG)
   - Create a detailed situation description
   - Define the mission parameters
   - Compile any additional relevant details
   - Select an appropriate map for the scenario
   - Develop a comprehensive answer key

2. Prepare the scenario content
   - Utilize AI assistance to convert the scenario into HTML format
   - Ensure all content is properly formatted and structured

3. Add the new scenario to the database
   - Insert a new row into the `missions` table with the following information:
     - Assign a unique mission ID
     - Provide a descriptive mission name
     - Insert the HTML-formatted situation, mission, and additional details
     - Include the map reference (e.g., `/maps/scenario_map.png`)
     - Specify the answer key file name (e.g., `answerkey_X.txt`, where X is the mission ID)

4. Upload associated files
   - Place the map image in the appropriate directory
   - Add the answer key file to the designated folder

5. Test the new scenario
   - Access the new scenario via `mission.php?id=X` (replace X with the assigned mission ID)
   - Verify all content displays correctly
   - Ensure the mission flow functions as intended

Best Practices:
- Maintain consistency in HTML structure across scenarios
- Follow the established format for situations and answer keys (refer to `answers/desertplatoon.txt` and `answers/answerkey_1.txt` for examples)
- Regularly backup the database and associated files
- Consider version control for scenario content to track changes over time
